# 👋 Hi, I’m @tony-42069  

Welcome to the most *unexpectedly serious* GitHub profile on the planet.  

- 👀 **I’m interested in**: Turning AI, finance, and commercial real estate (CRE) tools into magic wands for businesses.  
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning**: How to make software so intuitive that even *Tony-42069* would say, "Wow, that’s usable."  
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on**: Projects where tech meets finance, CRE analysis, or just cool stuff that pushes boundaries.  
- 📫 **How to reach me**: [X](https://x.com/CREdebtDorian) or send a carrier pigeon with good vibes.  
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: When I’m not building software, I’m trying to master golf—because coding is easier than fixing my swing.
